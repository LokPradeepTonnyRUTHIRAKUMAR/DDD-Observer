# Domain Example - Studio Project Delivery ( Sasha13Studio )

## Goal
Model a studio that delivers premium websites (sometimes immersive/3D).
The domain layer contains only business rules and emits domain events.
Technical actions (email, logging, indexing) are plugged in via observers.

## Core Concepts (Ubiquitous Language)
 - **Client**: a customer buying a website project.
 - **Project**: a delivery unit that becomes a deployed website.
 - **OfferType**: `EssentialWebsite` or `Immersive Website`
 - **ProjectStatus**: `Draft -> DiscoveryDone -> DesignApproved -> BuildInProgress -> ReadyToDeploy -> Deployed`
 - **PerformanceBudgetMB**: maximum size (MB) for assets for immersive projects.

 ## Business Rules (Domain Logic)
 1. A project cannot be deployed unless:
 - status is `ReadyToDeploy`
 - design is approved (must have a `DesignApprovalDate`)
 2. Price must be > 0 (in EUR)
 3. Client email must be valid
 4. If OfferType is `ImmersiveWebsite`, PerformanceBudgetMB must be > 0
 5. Status changes must be forward-only

 ## State Changes (Commands / Methods)
 - `Project.completeDiscovery()`
 - `Project.approveDesign(date)`
 - `Project.startBuild()`
 - `Project.markReadyToDeploy()`
 - `Project.deploy(data)`

 ## Domain Events (Observer Pattern)
 - `DiscoveryCompleted`
 - `DesginApproved`
 - `BuildStarted`
 - `ProjectReadyToDeploy`
 - `ProjectDeployed`
 - `PerformanceBudgetExceeded` (dummy simulation)

 The domain emits events, but doesn't send emails or write logs.
 Observers handle side-effects:
 - Email observer: "Project deployed" -> send launch email
 - Portfolio observer: "Projecr deployed" -> update portfolio index
 - Logger observer: log all events

 ## Error Handling / Invalid Data
 We intentionally feed wrong data (bad email, negavite price, invalid status transactions).
 The app must not crash: all failures are caught with try/catch and logged.
